# Teamlytical

Teamlytical is aimed to create a website intended for project collaboration. Users will be able to make posts labeling what they need help with, including any 
skills that might be of use. Other website users will then have the option to demonstrate their interest in these posts, signaling to the post creator that they 
have met potential collaborators. These projects will surround computer coding, both for web design as well as developing programs. By providing one website 
specifically to find coding associates, users can avoid the havoc and miscommunication involved with other job-searching websites. 
The platform will also give an option to share their projects with people, non-collaborators, allowing many to get inspired, create improved versions, or create 
brand new projects.


This is a group project for fall 2021 Intro to ITWS, ITWS 1100. This was not meant to be fully functional and there are some issues with the code (mostly only with 
backend/php)
